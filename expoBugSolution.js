The solution focuses on ensuring the correct usage of modules within Expo's managed workflow.  This includes:

1. **Using Expo-compatible modules:**  Replace problematic modules with Expo compatible alternatives where applicable.  Expo's documentation lists supported packages.
2. **Correct Installation and Version Management:** 
```javascript
npm install react-native-unimodules //If working with native modules.
npm install <package_name>@<compatible_version> // Install the correct version of your package
```
3. **Checking for Conflicts:** Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to identify potential dependency conflicts that are interfering with imports. Consider using a package manager like Yarn for better dependency resolution.
4. **Troubleshooting:**  If the error persists, provide the exact error message and relevant parts of your code for better troubleshooting.  Check Expo's forums and documentation for solutions to similar errors.
