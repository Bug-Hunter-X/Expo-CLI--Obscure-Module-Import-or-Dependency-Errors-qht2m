# Expo CLI: Obscure Module Import or Dependency Errors

This repository demonstrates a common but elusive issue in Expo CLI projects: encountering vague error messages when importing or using modules.  The lack of specific error information makes debugging challenging.  This example focuses on scenarios where the managed workflow's limitations or dependency issues lead to cryptic error messages.

## Reproducing the Issue

Follow the steps below to reproduce this problem:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the command line.
3. Install the required packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Run the Expo project using `expo start`. 
5. Observe the error message in the terminal, indicating the problem with module imports. 

## Solution

The provided `expoBugSolution.js` file shows how to resolve this type of error, primarily focusing on:

* **Verifying Package Compatibility:** Ensure the package being imported is compatible with the Expo managed workflow. 
* **Correct Installation:** Verify that the package is installed correctly using `npm list` or `yarn why`. 
* **Dependency Management:** Resolve dependency conflicts. Check your package.json or yarn.lock for any conflicting versions.
* **Expo SDK Versions:** Check if your package and expo SDK versions are compatible. You may need to upgrade or downgrade to compatible versions.

## Additional Notes

Always consult the Expo documentation and the package's own documentation for compatibility and usage instructions.
